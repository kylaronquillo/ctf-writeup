### Step 1
I first run the file in vscode but it indicated that it couldnâ€™t find the file anywhere. Since there are no other factors to consider, and upon looking at the code, I came to a conclusion that VSCode is preventing the python script from accessing the enc file.
Enc Tool info: https://pypi.org/project/enc-tool/ 
### Step 2
I searched the net of other ways to run python script and learned that u can run python script in terminal by opening the file using nano. 
### Step 3
After opening it using nano and then saving it, I run the script file and it showed me the flag.
### Step 4
The password for the flag was in the python code.
